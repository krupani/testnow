# testnow

An instant WebDriver-Ruby-Cucumber or WebDriver-Ruby-RSpec framework which has ability to do cross browser testing on any of the popular browsers, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Internet Explorer, Safari, Android Browser. It uses the selenium-webdriver to driver the browsers already installed on your box.

[NOTE] -- This gem does not provide any webdrivers or install any browsers, it is related to browser configuration and framework generation. For the tests to run, browsers should be installed and webdrivers should be present in the path variable.

## Installation  
There are multiple ways in which you can install and use testnow gem.
You must have Ruby installed before you can install this gem.   

### <a name="gem" /> 1. Install using gem command
Just use following command from you Terminal.
``` 
gem install testnow 
```
   
### <a name="bundler" /> 2. Install using bundler    
You can include it in your Gemfile and run bundle install

``` 
gem 'testnow' 
```   
then run following   
```   
bundle install   
```   
  
  
## Setup   
   
### <a name="cross"></a> 1. Cross browser configuration using testnow for your existing project     
When creating a Selenium-WebDriver automation suite, if one requires cross browser testing, the biggest headache is configuring all browsers mainly because configurations for every browser is done differently. This is where TestNow gem jumps in as an Asprin to cure your headache by taking care of  browser configurations for you.   

Unlike some very famous Ruby-WebDriver tools which wraps up the WebDriver object and provides its own set of commands, TestNow gem returns you the ```driver``` object as is but initialized with any browser of your choice.

In your existing automation suite, require and include the testnow gem in your config file 
(i.e usually env.rb for cucumber or spec_helper for rspec depending on your framework)

```
require 'testnow'   

include TestNow             # for basic webdriver framework   
   
include TestNow::Watir      # for watir webdriver framework   
```

now as everything is required, included and ready, just put the following command in the setup method. (Setup method is where WebDriver is initialized with a certain browser and a driver object is created. i.e hooks.rb file for cucumber)

```
@driver = TestNow.init
```

TestNow gem uses the environment variable __BROWSER__ to detect which browser to initialize. If no value is set for this variable then firefox will be initialized by default.

### <a name="cli"></a> 2. Command Line Tool -- testnow command
When you install testnow gem, it installs a command line tool which helps you to create automation frameworks with cross browser configuration in a jiffy.   
This command line tool has multiple command and can be seen using help
Following are the list of commands:   
    
![help, version, cucumber_now, rspec_now, watir_cucumber_now, watir_rspec_now](https://github.com/krupani/testnow/blob/master/images/commands.png)


  
## Usage
   
### <a name="cuke"></a> 1. Instantly create a fresh Cucumber-WebDriver framework   

```
testnow cucumber_now
```  
This will run a series of commands and create a WebDriver-Ruby-Cucumber framework for you in a directory called __cucumber_now__. It will towards the end also ask you for gem dependency installation and it is highly recommended to say Yes. It will also create a sample scenario with a feature file and also a hooks and env file with all configurations. This scenario can be executed by simple command to see a demo of the execution.

``` 
cd cucumber_now                      # Navigate into the created directory   

Command 1 : cucumber features        # Executes using cucumber gem executable
or
Command 2 : rake testnow        # Executes using cucumber rake task
```   
  
Use any of the command to execute the sample scenario. A beautiful, screenshot embedded report will be created by this execution to in the reports directory. It will be in html format, please double click or open in a browser to view it.   


### <a name="rspec"></a> 2. Instantly create a fresh RSpec-WebDriver framework   

```
testnow rspec_now
```

## Variables
### <a name="browser"></a> 1. BROWSER
Using testnow for existing project or creating a fresh framework from the testnow command line tool, there an environment variable which is consumed by the execution which is called __BROWSER__. One can pass the browser of its choice to this variable to execute tests in different browsers. The default value is set to firefox.

For example, in above sample scenario.
```
rake testnow BROWSER=chrome
or  
rake testnow BROWSER=opera
```

[NOTE: This will work provided you have webdrivers placed in PATH varibale. i.e chromedriver or operadriver]
   
### <a name="test-url"></a> 2. TEST_URL
This variable currently only works if you create a framework from testnow command line tool. This variable is called __TEST_URL__ and it gives you the power to pass the test url as a parameter. As we know that there can be multiple test environment and not necessarily we would need to run our tests on 1 environment. So to avaoid changing the code, testnow provides exposure of test url.   
    
For Example:
```
rake testnow BROWSER=chrome TEST_URL=https://github.com
```   
   
### <a name="device"></a> 3. DEVICE
This variable is only required when using Chrome Mobile emulation browser. This is a feature by Google Chrome provided for testing mobile websites how it will look on chrome browser on various devices. For eg: Google Chrome on Apple iPhone 6 Plus or Google Chrome on Samsung Galaxy Note 3. The list of devices can be found on [here](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/). Now coming back to how to use this variable. We need to pass the DEVICE name when choosing BROWSER=mobilechrome.  
  
For example
```   
rake testnow BROWSER=mobile_chrome DEVICE="Apple iPhone 6"   
or   
rake testnow BROWSER=chrome_mobile DEVICE="Samsung Galaxy Note 3"  
or  
rake testnow BROWSER="Mobile Chrome" DEVICE=Google_Nexus_6
```   
 __Note: If certain devices are not found on your chrome then firstly update your chrome to latest version and then turn on the devices and device mode from developer tools options__



## Browsers  
As mentioned in the above section that there is a variable exposed called _BROWSER_ but what are the values to be passed and which OS-Browsers combinations are supported, well here is a index grid below:

| OS  | Chrome  | Firefox (v47-)  | Firefox Gecko (v48+)  | IE 11/10   | Edge  | Opera  | PhantomJS   | Chrome Mobile[2]   |    
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|    
| Linux     | Supported  | Supported  | Supported  | N/A         | N/A         | Supported[1]  | Coming Soon!  | Supported  |   
| Mac       | Supported  | Supported  | Supported  | N/A         | N/A         | Supported[1]  | Coming Soon!  | Supported  |     
| Windows   | Supported  | Supported  | Supported  | Supported   | Supported[3]| Coming Soon!  | Coming Soon!  | Supported  |    
  
Note:  
[1] Currently it is expected that the Opera webdriver binary is present inside "/usr/local/bin/operadriver, soon this path will be made customizable and exposaed as a varibale.   
[2] This is not another browser, it is the mobile emulation which Google Chrome proovides through its developer tools.   
[3] Please download the required Microsoft WebDriver as per your windows 10 build number. Windows 10 build can be checked with the `winver` command.
